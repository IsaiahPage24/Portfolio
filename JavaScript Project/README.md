# Overview

This JavaScript project is a game of blackjack you can play right in your own browser. The purpose for creating this project was for me to learn the basics and practice with the JavaScript Language. I have had experience in the past creating basic webpages, but I wanted more functionality in what I was doing. JavaScript was the perfect next step to learn in order to bring my ides to life. I also want to develop more of a habit and aptitude for learning new programming languages in order to broaden and widen my own toolbox.

The project itself is the basic logic behind the game Black Jack. I have a basic html and css file for the game to display, but all of the functions and logic for the game itself is in the blackjack.js file. The game starts when you click new game, and the dealer and players hands will appear on the screen. The goal is to get as close to a score of 21 as possible. You can do that by hitting or standing. The hit button will add one card to your hand, and the stand button will turn the action to the dealer. I have included a link with the complete rules of blackjack, in case you've never played or it's been a while.

# Development Environment

The code was developed in Visual Studio Code. I used HTML for the index file and CSS for the style sheet.
The script for the game logic was written in JavaScript. Learning JavaScript basics involved learning math functions, finding and mapping 
elements, and using the math library.
