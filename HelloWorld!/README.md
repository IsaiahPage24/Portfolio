## Overview

We all start from somewhere when learning to write code, and more often than not it has to do with **"Hello World"**. Here I have a basic python command which will print **"Hello World"** to the console. More importantly, this basic introduction will serve as a template for the rest of my code portfolio here on GitHub.

Each project will have a README beforehand, which will contain:
- A description of said project.
- The purpose behind the project.
- A video demonstration reviewing the principles behind my code.
- Description of the tools and languages used in each project.
- Useful websites and sources I used during the learning process.
